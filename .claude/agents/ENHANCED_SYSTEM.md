## 📊 **Master Orchestration System**

### **Workflow Dependencies & Execution**
```yaml
Phase 1: Security First (Critical - Blocking)
├── security-hardening workflow
└── Quality Gate: Zero critical vulnerabilities

Phase 2: Performance Optimization (High Priority)  
├── performance-optimization workflow
├── Depends on: security-hardening
└── Quality Gate: 5x throughput improvement

Phase 3: Code Quality Enhancement (High Priority)
├── code-quality-enhancement workflow  
├── Depends on: performance-optimization
└── Quality Gate: Go best practices compliance

Phase 4: Test Reliability (High Priority)

- **Quality Gate Hierarchy**: Multi-level validation with critical, workflow, and integration gates

#### **Resource Optimization**
- **Intelligent Allocation**: Dynamic compute/memory allocation based on workflow needs
- **Parallel Execution**: Up to 6 concurrent subagents with shared resource pools
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic workload distribution to prevent resource exhaustion

#### **Failure Recovery & Resilience**
- **Graduated Response**: Partial/critical/cascading failure handling strategies
- **Automatic Rollback**: Return to last stable state on critical failures
- **Subagent Redundancy**: Backup subagents for timeout and failure scenarios

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes**
