# Claude Agents Team Organization

This directory contains specialized Claude agents organized into teams for the Freightliner container registry replication project.

## Team Structure

### üöÄ Core Development Team
- **golang-pro**: Go language expert for idiomatic code, concurrency, and performance
- **test-automator**: Test suite creation, CI pipelines, and test coverage optimization
- **performance-engineer**: Application profiling, optimization, and load testing

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Team  
- **devops-troubleshooter**: Production debugging, incident response, and monitoring
- **cloud-architect**: AWS/GCP infrastructure design, Terraform, and cost optimization
- **deployment-engineer**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment automation

### üîí Quality Assurance Team
- **security-auditor**: Security reviews, vulnerability scanning, and compliance
- **code-reviewer**: Code quality, best practices, and maintainability
- **architect-review**: Architectural consistency, SOLID principles, and system design

### üìö Documentation Team
- **api-documenter**: OpenAPI specs, SDK generation, and developer documentation
- **context-manager**: Project context, requirements management, and coordination

### ü§ñ AI Enhancement Team
- **prompt-engineer**: LLM prompt optimization, AI system integration, and agent collaboration

## Current Project Focus Areas

### High Priority Tasks
1. **Container Registry Performance**: Optimize replication speed and memory usage
2. **Test Suite Reliability**: Fix flaky tests and improve CI stability  
3. **Security Hardening**: Audit authentication, encryption, and access controls
4. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and deployment guides

### Ongoing Initiatives
- **Go Code Quality**: Refactor for better concurrency patterns and error handling
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform modules for multi-cloud deployment
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced observability and alerting systems
- **Load Testing**: Performance benchmarks for large-scale deployments
