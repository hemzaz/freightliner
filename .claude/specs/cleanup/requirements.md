# Cleanup Command - Requirements

## Overview
The cleanup command provides comprehensive codebase maintenance by identifying and removing dead code, unused files, redundant configurations, and build artifacts that accumulate over time.

## User Stories

### US-1: Automated Dead Code Detection
**As a developer**, I want to automatically identify dead code and unused files, so that I can maintain a clean, focused codebase without manual inspection overhead.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I run `/cleanup scan`, THEN the system SHALL identify all potentially unused files with confidence levels
- WHEN scanning is complete, THEN the system SHALL categorize findings by type (dead code, build artifacts, empty directories, etc.)
- WHEN confidence levels are assigned, THEN the system SHALL use High/Medium/Low ratings based on usage analysis
- IF a file has no references and serves no active purpose, THEN it SHALL be marked as High confidence for removal

### US-2: Safe Incremental Cleanup
**As a developer**, I want to perform cleanup operations with safety controls, so that I can remove unnecessary files without breaking functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I run `/cleanup execute`, THEN the system SHALL only remove High confidence items by default
- WHEN executing cleanup, THEN the system SHALL verify functionality after each removal category
- WHEN verification fails, THEN the system SHALL halt cleanup and report the issue
- IF I specify `--include-medium`, THEN the system SHALL also process Medium confidence items with additional confirmation

### US-3: Build Artifact Management
**As a developer**, I want to automatically manage build artifacts, so that version control remains clean and build processes are reliable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN scanning for artifacts, THEN the system SHALL identify all files that should be generated, not committed
- WHEN cleaning artifacts, THEN the system SHALL remove committed binaries and generated files
- WHEN cleanup is complete, THEN the system SHALL verify that build processes can regenerate all artifacts
- IF artifacts are required for functionality, THEN the system SHALL document generation commands

### US-4: Configuration Consolidation
**As a developer**, I want to identify and remove redundant configurations, so that the project has a single source of truth for each concern.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN scanning configurations, THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate or superseded config files
- WHEN configurations conflict, THEN the system SHALL report the conflicts and recommend consolidation
- WHEN removing redundant configs, THEN the system SHALL update all references to use the canonical configuration
- IF configuration removal breaks functionality, THEN the system SHALL restore the configuration and report the dependency

### US-5: Documentation Maintenance
**As a developer**, I want to maintain documentation consistency, so that all references remain valid after cleanup operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN files are removed, THEN the system SHALL find and update all documentation references
- WHEN documentation becomes outdated, THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest updates
- WHEN references are broken, THEN the system SHALL provide suggested replacements or removal
- IF documentation is historical but valuable, THEN the system SHALL recommend archival rather than deletion

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Scan Performance**: Complete codebase scan in under 30 seconds for repositories up to 10GB
- **Incremental Updates**: Process only changed files since last scan for performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Maintain memory usage under 100MB during scan operations

### Safety Requirements
- **Backup Integration**: Integrate with version control to ensure all changes are tracked
- **Rollback Capability**: Provide immediate rollback for any cleanup operation
- **Verification Gates**: Verify build and test success after each cleanup category

### Usability Requirements
- **Clear Reporting**: Provide detailed reports of all proposed and executed changes
- **Confidence Indicators**: Show clear confidence levels for all removal recommendations
- **Interactive Mode**: Support interactive confirmation for Medium/Low confidence items

## Integration Requirements

### Version Control Integration
- **Git Integration**: Leverage git to identify uncommitted build artifacts
- **Branch Awareness**: Avoid cleanup of files modified in other branches
- **History Analysis**: Use git history to identify truly unused files

### Build System Integration
- **Makefile Analysis**: Parse Makefile to understand build dependencies
- **Test Integration**: Verify test suite passes after cleanup operations
- **CI/CD Compatibility**: Ensure cleanup doesn't break existing workflows

### Documentation Integration
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Identify all file references in documentation
- **Markdown Processing**: Update markdown files to fix broken references
- **Structure Validation**: Ensure documentation structure remains consistent
