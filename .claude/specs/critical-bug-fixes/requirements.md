# Requirements Document: Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

## Overview

Address critical bugs, design flaws, and stability issues identified in the Freightliner codebase that could cause production failures, security vulnerabilities, and resource leaks. This spec prioritizes issues that pose immediate risks to system stability and security.

## Product Vision Alignment

This effort directly supports the product vision of "maintaining consistent, secure, and highly available container images" by addressing fundamental reliability and security issues that could compromise service availability and data integrity.

## Code Analysis Findings

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Resource Cleanup Failures**: Temporary file cleanup race conditions and file descriptor leaks
2. **Concurrency Problems**: Goroutine leaks, race conditions, and deadlock potential
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Credential exposure, inadequate input validation
4. **Incomplete Implementations**: Stub functions causing silent failures
5. **Error Handling Gaps**: Inconsistent error propagation and incomplete error recovery

### Impact Assessment
- **Stability**: Resource leaks can cause service degradation and crashes
- **Security**: Credential exposure and CORS bypass vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Memory leaks and inefficient resource usage
- **Reliability**: Silent failures and incomplete error handling

### Production Readiness Context

Recent analysis has identified **47 critical production blockers** including:
- **15 Security vulnerabilities** (timing attacks, missing rate limiting, insecure CORS)
- **12 Reliability issues** (goroutine leaks, missing panic recovery, single points of failure)
- **8 Performance bottlenecks** (no horizontal scaling, memory buffering, no caching)
- **7 Operational readiness gaps** (no-op metrics, missing health checks, no deployment artifacts)
- **3 Data integrity issues** (no checksum validation, no atomic transactions)
- **2 Testing quality gaps** (44% coverage, no integration tests)

Critical bug fixes must be prioritized within this broader production readiness effort, focusing on **P0 blockers** that prevent any production deployment.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: System Reliability
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer  
**I want** the system to properly manage resources and handle errors consistently  
**So that** I can rely on stable, predictable service behavior in production

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN temporary files are created THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up even on error conditions
2. WHEN workers are spawned THEN they SHALL be properly terminated and cleaned up
3. IF errors occur during replication THEN they SHALL be properly logged and reported to callers

### User Story 2: Security Hardening
**As a** Security Engineer  
**I want** credentials and sensitive data to be handled securely  
**So that** there is no risk of credential exposure or unauthorized access

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN credentials are stored temporarily THEN they SHALL have restrictive file permissions
2. WHEN CORS validation occurs THEN it SHALL properly validate allowed origins
3. IF encryption operations fail THEN they SHALL fail securely without exposing data

### User Story 3: Resource Management
**As a** DevOps Engineer  
**I want** the system to efficiently manage memory and file descriptors  
**So that** the service can run stably under high load without resource exhaustion

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN worker pools are used THEN goroutines SHALL be properly terminated
2. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN response bodies SHALL be properly closed
3. IF memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully

### User Story 4: Error Transparency
**As a** Development Team Member  
**I want** comprehensive error reporting and consistent error handling  
**So that** I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues in production

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN operations fail THEN errors SHALL be properly wrapped with context
2. WHEN stub implementations are called THEN they SHALL return explicit "not implemented" errors
3. IF partial failures occur THEN they SHALL be clearly reported to callers

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Resource cleanup SHALL complete within 1 second
- Error handling SHALL not add more than 1ms overhead to operation latency
- Memory usage SHALL not grow unbounded due to resource leaks

### Reliability Requirements
- System SHALL not crash due to race conditions or resource exhaustion
- Failed operations SHALL be retryable and idempotent
- Critical errors SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging

### Security Requirements
- Temporary credential files SHALL have 0600 permissions
- Credentials SHALL not remain in environment variables after use
- Input validation SHALL prevent buffer overflows and injection attacks

### Observability Requirements
- All resource cleanup operations SHALL be logged
- Error metrics SHALL track failure rates and error types
- Performance metrics SHALL monitor resource usage patterns

## Priority Classification

### Critical (Must Fix Immediately)
1. **Temporary File Race Condition** (`pkg/service/replicate.go:886-903`)
   - **Risk**: File descriptor leaks, credential exposure
   - **Impact**: Service crashes, security vulnerabilities

2. **Worker Pool Context Leak** (`pkg/replication/worker_pool.go:116-130`)

   - **Impact**: Service degradation, eventual crash

3. **Scheduler Race Condition** (`pkg/replication/scheduler.go:285-291`)
   - **Risk**: Panic on nil pointer access
   - **Impact**: Service crashes, data corruption
