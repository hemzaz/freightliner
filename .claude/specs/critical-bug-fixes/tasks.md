- Race condition fixes must be verified with Go race detector
- Resource cleanup must be verified with resource leak tests
- Security fixes must include penetration testing

### Performance Requirements
- Resource cleanup must complete within 1 second
- Error handling overhead must be <1ms
- Memory usage must not grow unbounded
- HTTP connection pools must not be exhausted

### Testing Strategy
- Each fix must include failure scenario testing
- Concurrency testing with high load simulation
- Resource exhaustion testing and recovery
- Security vulnerability testing with malicious inputs

### Deployment Strategy
- Critical fixes deployed with immediate rollback capability
- Gradual rollout with monitoring and health checks
- Resource usage monitoring during deployment
- Performance regression testing in staging environment

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks
- **Task 1**: File system operations and cleanup timing
- **Task 3**: Worker pool lifecycle and goroutine management
- **Task 4**: Job state transitions and race conditions
- **Task 9**: Cryptographic operations and input validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Extensive testing in isolated environments
- Load testing with resource monitoring
- Security testing with threat modeling
- Gradual rollout with immediate rollback procedures
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all fixes

The critical nature of these fixes requires careful implementation with extensive testing and monitoring to ensure system stability while resolving the identified issues.
