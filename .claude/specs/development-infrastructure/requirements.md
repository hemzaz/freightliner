# Requirements Document: Development Infrastructure Enhancement

## Overview

Enhance Freightliner's development infrastructure by building upon the excellent foundation of existing automation tools, scripts, and Makefile targets to create a world-class development experience with CI/CD integration, performance optimization, and comprehensive developer tooling.

## Product Vision Alignment

This initiative supports the product vision by establishing robust development infrastructure that enables "consistent, secure, and highly available" software delivery through automated builds, testing, and deployment processes that maintain quality while accelerating development velocity.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure Assets
- **Comprehensive Makefile**: 20+ targets including setup, build, test, quality checks, and maintenance
- **Shell Script Automation**: organize_imports.sh, lint.sh, vet.sh, staticcheck.sh provide quality automation
- **Tool Configuration**: .golangci.yml, staticcheck.conf provide consistent tool settings
- **Pre-commit Integration**: scripts/pre-commit enables quality gates
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows environments

### Implementation Gaps Identified
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Local automation excellent but no CI/CD integration visible
2. **Tool Version Management**: Using @latest versions instead of pinned dependencies
3. **Performance Optimization**: Sequential execution could be parallelized for speed
4. **Monitoring and Metrics**: No build performance tracking or infrastructure health monitoring
5. **Environment Validation**: Setup works but lacks validation and health checks
6. **Dependency Management**: Manual tool installation without dependency management

## User Stories
