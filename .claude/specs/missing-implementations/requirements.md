# Requirements Document: Missing Implementations and Stub Completions

## Overview

Complete all stub implementations and missing functionality in the Freightliner codebase to provide full operational capabilities. This effort addresses critical gaps in secrets management, replication logic, network optimization, and enhanced repository features that currently limit production deployments.

## Product Vision Alignment

This initiative directly supports the product vision of "maintaining consistent, secure, and highly available container images across multiple cloud registries with minimal operational overhead" by completing core functionality that enables full-featured, production-ready operations.

## Code Analysis Findings

### Critical Missing Implementations
1. **Secrets Management Write Operations**: Cannot create, update, or delete secrets in AWS/GCP
2. **Tree Replication Core Logic**: Uses mock delays instead of actual replication
3. **Resume Functionality**: Incomplete checkpoint-based recovery system
4. **Network Compression**: Missing transfer optimization capabilities
5. **Enhanced Repository Features**: Advanced repository operations not implemented
6. **Authentication Systems**: Empty base authenticator implementations

### Impact on Production Readiness
- **Operational Limitations**: Core workflows like secrets management are read-only
- **Performance Gaps**: Missing compression reduces transfer efficiency
- **Reliability Issues**: Incomplete resume functionality affects large operations
- **Feature Completeness**: Advanced repository operations unavailable

## User Stories

4. WHEN resuming THEN it SHALL skip already-completed operations efficiently

### User Story 4: Network Performance Optimization
**As a** Operations Engineer  
**I want** compression and network optimization features  
**So that** replication operations use minimal bandwidth and complete faster

2. WHEN I call RefreshImages THEN it SHALL update cached image metadata
3. WHEN I call ListImageManifests THEN it SHALL return comprehensive manifest information
4. IF repository operations fail THEN they SHALL provide actionable error messages

### User Story 6: Complete Authentication System
**As a** Security Engineer  
**I want** proper authentication implementations  
**So that** all registry interactions are properly authenticated and secure

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL provide valid credentials
2. WHEN credentials expire THEN it SHALL refresh them automatically
3. IF authentication fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN multiple auth methods are available THEN it SHALL choose the most appropriate

- AWS Secrets Manager: 64KB limit per secret value
- GCP Secret Manager: 64KB limit per secret payload
- Rate limiting for secret operations across both providers
