# Requirements Document: Multi-Registry Policy Engine

## Overview

Enhance Freightliner with an intelligent policy engine that automatically determines replication strategies based on configurable rules, image metadata, and organizational policies. This feature enables organizations to implement sophisticated multi-cloud container distribution strategies without manual intervention.

## Product Vision Alignment

This feature directly supports the product vision of "maintaining consistent, secure, and highly available container images across multiple cloud registries with minimal operational overhead" by automating replication decisions through intelligent policy evaluation.

## Code Reuse Analysis

### Existing Components to Leverage
- **Policy Foundation**: `pkg/replication/config.go` and `pkg/replication/rules.go` provide basic rule matching infrastructure
- **Registry Clients**: `pkg/client/common/base_client.go` and registry-specific implementations (ECR/GCR) provide the interface for multi-registry operations
- **Configuration System**: `pkg/config/config.go` and `pkg/config/loading.go` provide the configuration framework
- **Service Layer**: `pkg/service/replicate.go` contains the core replication orchestration logic
- **Cron Scheduling**: `github.com/robfig/cron/v3` dependency already available for scheduled operations
- **Metrics Collection**: `pkg/metrics/metrics.go` and Prometheus integration for policy execution monitoring

### Extension Opportunities
- Build upon the existing `ReplicationRule` struct in `pkg/replication/config.go`
- Extend the `ReplicationService` in `pkg/service/replicate.go` with policy evaluation
- Utilize the established error handling patterns from `pkg/helper/errors/errors.go`
- Leverage the worker pool pattern from `pkg/replication/worker_pool.go` for policy execution

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Compliance-Driven Replication
**As a** Security Engineer  
**I want** to define policies that automatically replicate images with specific security labels to compliant regions  
**So that** I can ensure regulatory compliance without manual intervention

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an image is pushed with a "compliance-required" label THEN the system SHALL automatically replicate it to all GDPR-compliant regions
2. WHEN an image lacks required security scanning labels THEN the system SHALL reject replication to production registries
3. IF an image has expired security scan results THEN the system SHALL stop replicating it until re-scanned

### User Story 2: Environment-Based Distribution
**As a** DevOps Engineer  
**I want** to configure automatic replication policies based on image tags and metadata  
**So that** production images are distributed appropriately while development images stay in development registries

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an image is tagged with "prod-*" pattern THEN the system SHALL replicate to all production registries
2. WHEN an image is tagged with "dev-*" pattern THEN the system SHALL only replicate to development registries
3. IF an image has no environment tag THEN the system SHALL apply default sandbox policies

### User Story 3: Cost Optimization Through Intelligent Placement
**As a** Platform Engineer  
**I want** policies that consider network topology and usage patterns for optimal image placement  
**So that** I can minimize cross-region data transfer costs while maintaining availability

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN replicating to multiple regions THEN the system SHALL prioritize regions based on historical access patterns
2. WHEN network costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL consolidate images in cost-optimal regions
3. IF usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL automatically rebalance image distribution

### User Story 4: Disaster Recovery Automation
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer  
**I want** automatic failover policies that ensure image availability during outages  
**So that** deployments can continue even when primary registries are unavailable

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a primary registry becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically activate secondary registry replicas
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize any missed updates
3. IF multiple registries fail THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most critical images for recovery

### User Story 5: Multi-Tenancy and Isolation
**As a** Platform Administrator  
**I want** tenant-specific policies that ensure proper isolation and resource allocation  
**So that** different teams and projects have appropriate access controls and resource limits

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a tenant reaches storage limits THEN the system SHALL enforce cleanup policies for old images
2. WHEN images are tagged with tenant identifiers THEN the system SHALL apply tenant-specific replication rules
3. IF cross-tenant access is attempted THEN the system SHALL enforce isolation policies

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Policy evaluation SHALL complete within 100ms for typical rule sets
- The system SHALL support evaluation of up to 1000 concurrent policy decisions
- Policy rule changes SHALL propagate to all workers within 30 seconds

### Scalability Requirements
- The system SHALL support up to 10,000 active replication policies
- Policy evaluation SHALL scale horizontally with worker pool size
- Memory usage for policy storage SHALL not exceed 500MB per instance

### Reliability Requirements
- Policy engine availability SHALL be 99.9% or higher
- Failed policy evaluations SHALL be retried with exponential backoff
- Policy evaluation errors SHALL not impact core replication functionality

### Security Requirements
- Policy definitions SHALL support encrypted storage of sensitive criteria
- Policy changes SHALL be audited with full change history
- Access to policy management SHALL require appropriate RBAC permissions

### Observability Requirements
- All policy evaluations SHALL generate structured metrics
- Policy execution time and success rates SHALL be monitored
- Policy rule changes SHALL generate audit events

## Technical Constraints

### Existing Architecture Compliance
- Must integrate with existing `pkg/replication/` architecture
- Must support current configuration file format with backward compatibility
- Must work with existing registry client interfaces

### Resource Constraints
- Policy evaluation must not significantly impact replication performance
- Memory footprint for policy engine should be minimal
- CPU overhead for policy evaluation should be under 10% of total usage

### Integration Requirements
- Must support the existing Prometheus metrics framework
- Must integrate with current logging infrastructure using structured logging
- Must work with existing secrets management integration

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

### Policy Conflicts
- When multiple policies match the same image with conflicting actions
- When policy priorities are not clearly defined
- When circular dependencies exist in policy chains

### Resource Exhaustion
- When policy evaluation consumes excessive memory or CPU
- When policy-driven replication overwhelms registry rate limits
- When storage quotas are exceeded due to policy-driven replication

### Network and Connectivity Issues
- When policy evaluation requires external service calls that timeout
- When registry connectivity issues affect policy-driven replication
- When partial network failures affect multi-registry operations

### Configuration and Validation
- When policy syntax is invalid or malformed
- When policy references non-existent registries or resources
- When policy updates conflict with ongoing replication operations

## Success Metrics

### Operational Metrics
- Policy evaluation success rate > 99.5%
- Average policy evaluation time < 50ms
- Policy-driven replication accuracy > 99%

### Business Metrics
- 50% reduction in manual replication configuration tasks
- 30% improvement in compliance policy adherence
