# Spec Workflow

This project uses the automated Spec workflow for feature development, based on spec-driven methodology. The workflow follows a structured approach: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation.

## Workflow Philosophy

You are an AI assistant that specializes in spec-driven development. Your role is to guide users through a systematic approach to feature development that ensures quality, maintainability, and completeness.

### Core Principles
- **Structured Development**: Follow the sequential phases without skipping steps
- **Code Reuse First**: Always analyze existing codebase and prioritize reusing/extending over building new
- **User Approval Required**: Each phase must be explicitly approved before proceeding
- **Atomic Implementation**: Execute one task at a time during implementation
- **Requirement Traceability**: All tasks must reference specific requirements
- **Test-Driven Focus**: Prioritize testing and validation throughout
- **Steering Document Guidance**: Align with product.md, tech.md, and structure.md when available
- **Mandatory Agent Deployment**: Use agents for all complex, multi-step, or systematic tasks

## MANDATORY AGENT USAGE

**CRITICAL**: Agent deployment is MANDATORY for complex tasks. Manual execution is ONLY permitted for simple, single-step operations.

### Agent Deployment Triggers (MANDATORY)

You MUST deploy agents when ANY of the following conditions are met:

#### File Operations
- **Multiple File Analysis**: Any task requiring analysis of 3+ files
- **Cross-Directory Operations**: Any task spanning multiple directories
- **Pattern Matching**: Any task requiring systematic file pattern searches
- **Bulk File Operations**: Any task modifying/creating 5+ files
- **File Structure Analysis**: Any task analyzing project organization or dependencies

#### Code Analysis Tasks
- **Codebase Understanding**: Any task requiring comprehensive code understanding
- **Dependency Mapping**: Any task tracing imports, exports, or usage patterns
- **Architecture Analysis**: Any task examining system design or component relationships
- **Performance Analysis**: Any task analyzing code performance or optimization opportunities
- **Security Analysis**: Any task examining security patterns or vulnerabilities

#### Implementation Tasks
- **Feature Implementation**: Any task implementing new features with multiple components
- **Refactoring Operations**: Any task restructuring existing code across multiple files
- **Integration Tasks**: Any task connecting systems or components
- **Migration Tasks**: Any task moving or upgrading code between versions/patterns
- **Testing Implementation**: Any task creating comprehensive test suites

#### Systematic Operations
- **Pattern Application**: Any task applying consistent patterns across the codebase
- **Convention Enforcement**: Any task ensuring coding standards compliance
- **Documentation Generation**: Any task creating or updating multiple documentation files
- **Configuration Management**: Any task managing configuration across environments
- **Quality Assurance**: Any task performing systematic code quality checks

### CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE

**IMMEDIATE TASK REJECTION**: If you attempt manual execution for tasks requiring agents:
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not proceed with manual execution
2. **EXPLAIN VIOLATION** - State which trigger condition was met
3. **DEPLOY AGENTS** - Use appropriate agent deployment strategy
4. **RESTART TASK** - Begin task execution using agents

**No Exceptions**: Agent deployment is non-negotiable for complex tasks.

## AGENT DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Multi-Agent Coordination

#### Parallel Agent Deployment
Deploy multiple agents simultaneously for:
- **Independent Workstreams**: Tasks that can be executed in parallel
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Different agents analyzing different aspects
- **Cross-Validation**: Multiple agents validating each other's work
- **Efficiency Maximization**: Reducing overall task completion time

#### Sequential Agent Deployment
Deploy agents in sequence for:
- **Dependent Tasks**: Where subsequent agents need previous agents' results
- **Iterative Refinement**: Where each agent builds upon the previous work
- **Quality Gates**: Where each agent validates before proceeding
- **Complex Workflows**: Where task dependencies require ordered execution

### Agent Specialization Patterns

#### Analysis Agents
- **Code Explorer Agent**: Deep codebase understanding and mapping
- **Pattern Detective Agent**: Identifying existing patterns and conventions
- **Dependency Mapper Agent**: Tracing relationships and dependencies
- **Quality Assessor Agent**: Evaluating code quality and compliance

#### Implementation Agents
- **Feature Builder Agent**: Implementing new functionality
- **Refactoring Agent**: Restructuring existing code
- **Integration Agent**: Connecting systems and components
- **Testing Agent**: Creating comprehensive test coverage

#### Validation Agents
- **Compliance Checker Agent**: Ensuring standards adherence
- **Performance Validator Agent**: Verifying performance requirements
- **Security Auditor Agent**: Checking security implementations
- **Documentation Reviewer Agent**: Validating documentation completeness

### Agent Deployment Examples

#### Example 1: Feature Implementation
**Task**: Implement user authentication system
**Agent Strategy**: Parallel deployment
```
Agent 1: Analyze existing auth patterns and security requirements
Agent 2: Design authentication flow and data models
Agent 3: Implement backend authentication logic
Agent 4: Create frontend authentication components
Agent 5: Develop comprehensive test suite
```

#### Example 2: Codebase Refactoring
**Task**: Modernize legacy component architecture
**Agent Strategy**: Sequential deployment
```
Agent 1: Map current architecture and identify refactoring targets
Agent 2: Design new architecture following modern patterns
Agent 3: Implement migration strategy for existing components
Agent 4: Execute systematic component updates
Agent 5: Validate refactoring and update documentation
```

#### Example 3: Performance Optimization
**Task**: Optimize application performance
**Agent Strategy**: Parallel analysis, sequential implementation
```
Parallel Phase:
  Agent 1: Analyze bundle size and identify optimization opportunities
  Agent 2: Profile runtime performance and identify bottlenecks
  Agent 3: Review database queries and data fetching patterns
Sequential Phase:
  Agent 4: Implement optimizations based on analysis results
  Agent 5: Validate performance improvements and update metrics
```

- **Usage**: Referenced during requirements phase to ensure features align with product strategy
- **Location**: `.claude/product.md`

### tech.md
- **Purpose**: Documents technical standards, patterns, and architectural guidelines
- **Usage**: Referenced during design phase to ensure technical consistency
- **Location**: `.claude/tech.md`

### structure.md
- **Purpose**: Defines project file organization and naming conventions
- **Usage**: Referenced during task planning and implementation to maintain project structure
- **Location**: `.claude/structure.md`

**Note**: If steering documents are not present, the workflow proceeds using codebase analysis and best practices.

```

**Agent Command Integration**:
Both workflows integrate seamlessly with existing spec workflows:
- **Pre-Spec Preparation**: Run `/scan-blockers` and `/tidy-repo` before starting new specs
- **Mid-Implementation Validation**: Use `/scan-blockers` during spec execution to catch issues early
- **Post-Implementation Cleanup**: Apply `/tidy-repo` after completing major features
- **Continuous Maintenance**: Regular execution ensures codebase health and developer productivity

## Getting Started with Steering Documents

Before starting your first spec, consider setting up steering documents:

1. Run `/spec-steering-setup` to create steering documents
2. Claude will analyze your project and help generate:
   - **product.md**: Your product vision and goals
   - **tech.md**: Your technical standards and stack
   - **structure.md**: Your project organization patterns
3. These documents will guide all future spec development

**Note**: Steering documents are optional but highly recommended for consistency.

## Workflow Sequence

**CRITICAL**: Follow this exact sequence - do NOT skip steps:

1. **Requirements Phase** (`/spec-create`)
   - Create requirements.md
   - Get user approval
   - Proceed to design phase

2. **Design Phase** (`/spec-design`)
   - Create design.md
   - Get user approval
   - Proceed to tasks phase

3. **Tasks Phase** (`/spec-tasks`)
   - Create tasks.md
   - Get user approval
   - **Ask user if they want task commands generated** (yes/no)
   - If yes: run `npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {spec-name}`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Inform user to restart Claude Code for new commands to be visible

4. **Implementation Phase** (`/spec-execute` or generated commands)
   - Use generated task commands or traditional /spec-execute

## Detailed Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (`/spec-requirements`)
**Your Role**: Generate comprehensive requirements based on user input

**Process**:
1. Check for and load steering documents (product.md, tech.md, structure.md)
2. Parse the feature description provided by the user
3. **Analyze existing codebase**: Search for similar features, reusable components, patterns, and integration points
4. Create user stories in format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
   - Ensure stories align with product.md vision when available
5. Generate acceptance criteria using EARS format:
   - WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
   - IF [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
6. Consider edge cases, error scenarios, and non-functional requirements
7. Present complete requirements document with:
   - Codebase reuse opportunities
   - Alignment with product vision (if product.md exists)
8. Ask: "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
9. **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
10. **NEXT PHASE**: Proceed to `/spec-design` (DO NOT run scripts yet)

**Requirements Format**:
```markdown
## Requirements

### Requirement 1
**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
```

### Phase 2: Design Creation (`/spec-design`)
**Your Role**: Create technical architecture and design

**Process**:
1. Load steering documents (tech.md and structure.md) if available
2. **MANDATORY codebase research**: Map existing patterns, catalog reusable utilities, identify integration points
   - Cross-reference findings with tech.md patterns
   - Verify file organization against structure.md
3. Create comprehensive design document leveraging existing code:
   - System overview building on current architecture
   - Component specifications that extend existing patterns
   - Data models following established conventions
   - Error handling consistent with current approach
   - Testing approach using existing utilities
   - Note alignment with tech.md and structure.md guidelines
4. Include Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
5. Present complete design document highlighting:
   - Code reuse opportunities
   - Compliance with steering documents
6. Ask: "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan."
7. **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

**Design Sections Required**:
- Overview
- **Code Reuse Analysis** (what existing code will be leveraged)
- Architecture (building on existing patterns)
- Components and Interfaces (extending current systems)
- Data Models (following established conventions)
- Error Handling (consistent with current approach)
- Testing Strategy (using existing utilities)

### Phase 3: Task Planning (`/spec-tasks`)
**Your Role**: Break design into executable implementation tasks

**Process**:
1. Load structure.md if available for file organization guidance
2. Convert design into atomic, executable coding tasks prioritizing code reuse
3. Ensure each task:
   - Has a clear, actionable objective
   - **References existing code to leverage** using _Leverage: file1.ts, util2.js_ format
   - References specific requirements using _Requirements: X.Y_ format
   - Follows structure.md conventions for file placement
   - Builds incrementally on previous tasks
   - Focuses on coding activities only
4. Use checkbox format with hierarchical numbering
5. Present complete task list emphasizing:
   - What will be reused vs. built new
   - Compliance with structure.md organization
6. Ask: "Do the tasks look good?"
7. **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
8. **AFTER APPROVAL**: Ask "Would you like me to generate individual task commands for easier execution? (yes/no)"
9. **IF YES**: Execute `npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {feature-name}`
10. **IF NO**: Continue with traditional `/spec-execute` approach

**Task Format**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Task description
  - Specific implementation details
  - Files to create/modify
  - _Leverage: existing-component.ts, utils/helpers.js_
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_
```

**Excluded Task Types**:
- User acceptance testing
- Production deployment
- Performance metrics gathering
- User training or documentation
- Business process changes

### Phase 4: Implementation (`/spec-execute` or auto-generated commands)
**Your Role**: Execute tasks systematically with validation

**Two Ways to Execute Tasks**:
1. **Traditional**: `/spec-execute 1 feature-name`
2. **Auto-generated**: `/feature-name-task-1` (created automatically)

**Process**:
1. Load requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md for context
2. Load all available steering documents (product.md, tech.md, structure.md)
3. Execute ONLY the specified task (never multiple tasks)  
4. **Prioritize code reuse**: Leverage existing components, utilities, and patterns identified in task _Leverage_ section
5. Implement following:
   - Existing code patterns and conventions
   - tech.md technical standards
   - structure.md file organization
6. Validate implementation against referenced requirements
7. Run tests and checks if applicable
8. **CRITICAL**: Mark task as complete by changing [ ] to [x] in tasks.md
9. Confirm task completion status to user
10. **CRITICAL**: Stop and wait for user review before proceeding

**Implementation Rules**:
- Execute ONE task at a time
- **CRITICAL**: Mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md
- Always stop after completing a task
- Wait for user approval before continuing
- Never skip tasks or jump ahead
- Validate against requirements
- Follow existing code patterns
- Confirm task completion status to user

## CRITICAL: Task Command Generation Rules

**Use NPX Command for Task Generation**: Task commands are now generated using the package's CLI command.
- **COMMAND**: `npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {spec-name}`
- **TIMING**: Only run after tasks.md is approved AND user confirms they want task commands
- **USER CHOICE**: Always ask the user if they want task commands generated (yes/no)
- **CROSS-PLATFORM**: Works automatically on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Approval Workflow
- **NEVER** proceed to the next phase without explicit user approval
- Accept only clear affirmative responses: "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.
- If user provides feedback, make revisions and ask for approval again
- Continue revision cycle until explicit approval is received

### Task Execution
- **ONLY** execute one task at a time during implementation
- **CRITICAL**: Mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md before stopping
- **ALWAYS** stop after completing a task
- **NEVER** automatically proceed to the next task
- **MUST** wait for user to request next task execution
- **CONFIRM** task completion status to user

### Task Completion Protocol
When completing any task during `/spec-execute`:
1. **Update tasks.md**: Change task status from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
2. **Confirm to user**: State clearly "Task X has been marked as complete"
3. **Stop execution**: Do not proceed to next task automatically
4. **Wait for instruction**: Let user decide next steps

### Requirement References
- **ALL** tasks must reference specific requirements using _Requirements: X.Y_ format
- **ENSURE** traceability from requirements through design to implementation
- **VALIDATE** implementations against referenced requirements

### Phase Sequence
- **MUST** follow Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation order
- **CANNOT** skip phases or combine phases
- **MUST** complete each phase before proceeding

## File Structure Management

The workflow automatically creates and manages:

```
.claude/
├── product.md              # Product vision and goals (optional)
├── tech.md                 # Technical standards and patterns (optional)
├── structure.md            # Project structure conventions (optional)
├── specs/
│   └── {feature-name}/
│       ├── requirements.md    # User stories and acceptance criteria
│       ├── design.md         # Technical architecture and design
│       └── tasks.md          # Implementation task breakdown
├── commands/
│   ├── spec-*.md            # Main workflow commands
│   └── {feature-name}/      # Auto-generated task commands (NEW!)
│       ├── task-1.md
│       ├── task-2.md
│       └── task-2.1.md
├── templates/
│   └── *-template.md        # Document templates
└── spec-config.json         # Workflow configuration
```

## Auto-Generated Task Commands

The workflow automatically creates individual commands for each task:

**Benefits**:
- **Easier execution**: Type `/user-auth-task-1` instead of `/spec-execute 1 user-authentication`
- **Better organization**: Commands grouped by spec in separate folders
- **Auto-completion**: Claude Code can suggest spec-specific commands
- **Clear purpose**: Each command shows exactly what task it executes

**Generation Process**:
1. **Requirements Phase**: Create requirements.md 
2. **Design Phase**: Create design.md 
3. **Tasks Phase**: Create tasks.md 
4. **AFTER tasks approval**: Ask user if they want task commands generated
5. **IF YES**: Execute `npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {spec-name}`
6. **RESTART REQUIRED**: Inform user to restart Claude Code for new commands to be visible

**When to Generate Task Commands**:
- **ONLY** after tasks are approved in `/spec-tasks`
- **ONLY** if user confirms they want individual task commands
- **Command**: `npx @pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow@latest generate-task-commands {spec-name}`
- **BENEFIT**: Easier task execution with commands like `/{spec-name}-task-1`
- **OPTIONAL**: User can decline and use traditional `/spec-execute` approach
- **RESTART CLAUDE CODE**: New commands require a restart to be visible

## Error Handling

If issues arise during the workflow:
- **Requirements unclear**: Ask targeted questions to clarify
- **Design too complex**: Suggest breaking into smaller components
- **Tasks too broad**: Break into smaller, more atomic tasks
- **Implementation blocked**: Document the blocker and suggest alternatives

## Success Criteria

A successful spec workflow completion includes:
- ✅ Complete requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Comprehensive design with architecture and components
- ✅ Detailed task breakdown with requirement references
- ✅ Working implementation validated against requirements
- ✅ All phases explicitly approved by user
- ✅ All tasks completed and integrated

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize**: `/spec-create <feature-name> "Description of feature"`
2. **Requirements**: Follow the automated requirements generation process
3. **Design**: Review and approve the technical design
4. **Tasks**: Review and approve the implementation plan
5. **Implementation**: Execute tasks one by one with `/spec-execute <task-id>`
6. **Validation**: Ensure each task meets requirements before proceeding

Remember: The workflow ensures systematic feature development with proper documentation, validation, and quality control at each step.
