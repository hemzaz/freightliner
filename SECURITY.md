# Security Policy

## Overview

The Freightliner project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policies, procedures, and contact information for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

Freightliner implements multiple layers of security controls:

1. **Code Security**
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with Gosec
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning with govulncheck
   - Secret scanning with GitLeaks
   - Code review requirements for all changes

2. **Container Security**
   - Security-hardened multi-stage Dockerfiles
   - Non-root user execution
   - Minimal attack surface with scratch/distroless base images
   - Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
   - Image signing with Cosign/Sigstore

3. **CI/CD Security**
   - Hardened GitHub Actions runners
   - OIDC authentication with minimal permissions
   - SHA-pinned action versions
   - Security gates blocking vulnerable deployments
   - SLSA Level 3 build provenance

4. **Runtime Security**
   - Least privilege access controls
   - Network segmentation
   - Resource limits and quotas
   - Health checks and monitoring
   - Automated incident response

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**
   - Follow [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
   - Handle errors securely without information leakage

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
   - Review dependency security advisories regularly
   - Use `go mod tidy` and `go mod verify` in builds
   - Monitor for known vulnerabilities with automated tools

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables or secure secret stores
   - Rotate secrets regularly (max 90 days)
   - Use least privilege access for service accounts

4. **Code Reviews**
   - All code changes require security-aware review
   - Pay special attention to authentication and authorization
   - Review error handling and logging practices
   - Validate input sanitization and output encoding

### For Operations

1. **Deployment Security**
   - Use security-hardened container images
   - Implement network segmentation and firewalls
   - Enable audit logging for all security events
   - Monitor for unusual activity patterns

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Regular access reviews and deprovisioning

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Deploy security monitoring tools (SIEM)
   - Set up automated alerting for security events
   - Implement anomaly detection
   - Regular security posture assessments
