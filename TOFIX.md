   - Added proper defer patterns for file closing and removal
   - Implemented secure handling of credential files

2. **✅ Context Leaks**: Implemented proper context cancellation.
   - Added WithCancel pattern for all long-running operations
   - Ensured proper resource cleanup through defer statements
   - Propagated contexts consistently through function calls

3. **✅ GCP KMS Key Validation**: Added comprehensive validation.
   - Added key reference format validation
   - Implemented key existence and status checking
   - Added error handling for invalid key configurations

4. **✅ Hardcoded GCP KMS Values**: Made key ring and key names configurable.
   - Added `gcpKeyRing` and `gcpKeyName` to encryption options structure
   - Created CLI flags `--gcp-key-ring` and `--gcp-key-name` with defaults
   - Updated logging to expose key configuration for auditability

5. **✅ Insecure Checkpoint Storage**: Secured checkpoint storage location.
   - Changed default from `/tmp/freightliner-checkpoints` to `${HOME}/.freightliner/checkpoints`
   - Added HOME directory expansion in FileStore implementation
   - Enforced 0700 permissions (owner-only access) for checkpoint directories
   - Implemented permission validation and auto-fixing

6. **✅ Removed Signing Functionality**: Completely eliminated signing-related code.
   - Removed all flags, variables, and implementation code
   - Simplified security model and reduced attack surface
   - Eliminated dependencies on signing libraries

## Pending Issues

### Test Suite Updates

1. **Test Failures**: Tests need updates to match new code structure.
   - Impact: Tests may fail with the new code organization
   - Solution: Update test files to use new interfaces and structures

### Placeholder Implementations

1. **✅ Replication Worker Pool Null Pointer**:
   - **File**: `pkg/replication/reconciler.go`
   - **Issue**: The `ReconcileRepository` method used `r.workerPool.Submit()` without checking if null
   - **Fixed**: Added null checks before using workerPool. Now gracefully falls back to running tasks synchronously if no worker pool is available and adds proper logging.

2. **✅ GCR Client Mock Implementation**:
   - **File**: `pkg/client/gcr/client.go`
   - **Issue**: `ListRepositories()` uses hardcoded mock repositories
   - **Fixed**: Implemented proper Google Container Registry API with both Artifact Registry client and direct GCR API for listing repositories with proper filtering and pagination.


3. **✅ Delta Implementation**:
   - **File**: `pkg/network/delta.go`
   - **Issue**: Delta implementations didn't use real delta compression
   - **Fixed**: Implemented a full production-ready delta compression system with multiple formats:
     - BSDiff format: Prefix/suffix optimization with middle section replacement
     - Simple format: Same approach but with simpler algorithm
     - Chunk-based format: For very large files, breaks into chunks and only transfers modified ones
     - Identical format: Special case for identical content with zero transfer
     - Added robust header with digest verification

4. **Tree Replication Issues**:
   - **File**: `pkg/tree/replicator.go`
   - **Issue**: Repository creation and tracking issues in tests
   - **Fix**: Correct the implementation to properly create and track repositories

5. **Checkpoint Counting Issues**:
   - **File**: `pkg/tree/checkpoint/resume.go`
   - **Issue**: Incorrect repository counting implementation
   - **Fix**: Fix the logic for tracking completed repositories

### Performance Optimizations ✅

1. **✅ Inefficient Tag Filtering**: Optimized tag filtering algorithm.
   - Fixed: Implemented optimized pattern matching using specialized caches
   - Added pattern categorization for fast path processing
   - Pre-allocates result slices for better memory efficiency
   - Added explicit filterTags method with optimized algorithms

2. **✅ Worker Pool Configuration**: Made worker count fully configurable.
   - Fixed: Added global worker configuration with auto-detection
   - Added command-line flags for worker pool configuration
   - Implemented smart auto-detection based on CPU cores
   - Added distinct worker pool configurations for different modes

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling Style**: Mix of wrapped and direct error returns.
   - Impact: Makes debugging more challenging
   - Solution: Standardize error wrapping and context

2. **Unused Metrics Interface**: Metrics interface not fully utilized.
   - Location: `pkg/tree/replicator.go`
   - Impact: Missing observability capabilities
   - Solution: Integrate metrics collection throughout the codebase

### Documentation Needs

1. **API Documentation**: New interfaces require documentation.
   - Impact: Harder for contributors to understand the codebase
   - Solution: Add comprehensive API documentation

2. **Architecture Overview**: Missing high-level explanation.
   - Impact: Harder to understand component relationships
   - Solution: Create architecture diagram and component documentation
