```yaml
env:
  GO_VERSION: '1.23.4'
  GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION: 'v1.62.2'
  PIPELINE_RELIABILITY_ENABLED: 'true'
  MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: '3'
  HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT: '60'
  ENABLE_FALLBACK_MECHANISMS: 'true'
```

2. Configure GitHub Secrets (optional):
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for Slack notifications
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` for Teams notifications
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage reporting

**Validation:**
```bash
# Check environment variables are accessible
echo $GO_VERSION
echo $PIPELINE_RELIABILITY_ENABLED
```

### 2. Reliability Scripts Deployment

**Files to Deploy:**
- `.github/scripts/ci-reliability.sh`
- `.github/scripts/pipeline-recovery.sh`
- `.github/scripts/pipeline-monitoring.sh`

**Steps:**
1. Create scripts directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .github/scripts
```

2. Copy reliability scripts with proper permissions:
```bash
cp ci-reliability.sh .github/scripts/
cp pipeline-recovery.sh .github/scripts/
cp pipeline-monitoring.sh .github/scripts/
chmod +x .github/scripts/*.sh
```

3. Test script functionality:
```bash
.github/scripts/pipeline-recovery.sh init
.github/scripts/pipeline-recovery.sh health-check
```

**Validation:**
- Scripts execute without errors
- Recovery state directory is created
- Health checks return valid status

### 3. Enhanced GitHub Actions

**Files to Deploy:**
- `.github/actions/setup-go/action.yml`
- `.github/actions/run-tests/action.yml`

**Steps:**
1. Create actions directories:
```bash
mkdir -p .github/actions/{setup-go,run-tests,setup-docker}
```

2. Deploy enhanced actions one by one:
```bash
# Deploy setup-go first (lowest risk)
cp setup-go/action.yml .github/actions/setup-go/
```

3. Update workflow to use enhanced actions:
```yaml
- name: Setup Go environment with reliability
  uses: ./.github/actions/setup-go
  with:
    go-version: ${{ env.GO_VERSION }}
    max-retries: ${{ env.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS }}
```

- Enhanced retry mechanisms activate
- Fallback proxies are configured

### 4. Pipeline Optimization Features

**Key Features to Enable:**
- Parallel job execution
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Circuit breaker patterns

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        test-type: [unit, integration]
```

2. Configure enhanced caching:
```yaml

  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/go-build
      ~/go/pkg/mod
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ env.CACHE_VERSION }}-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
```

3. Enable reliability features:
```yaml
env:

- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures

### 5. Docker Build Optimizations

**Files to Deploy:**
- `Dockerfile.optimized` (requires path fixes)
- `.dockerignore.optimized`

**Steps:**
1. Fix Docker build path issues:
```dockerfile
# Fix in Dockerfile.optimized
RUN go build -ldflags="-w -s" -trimpath -o /tmp/freightliner .
# Instead of ./cmd/freightliner
```

2. Deploy optimized Dockerfile:
```bash
cp Dockerfile.optimized .
cp .dockerignore.optimized .dockerignore
```

3. Update CI to prefer optimized Dockerfile:
```yaml
- name: Docker build with retry and recovery
  run: |
    if [[ -f "Dockerfile.optimized" ]]; then
      DOCKERFILE="Dockerfile.optimized"
    else
      DOCKERFILE="Dockerfile"
    fi

  if: always() && env.PIPELINE_RELIABILITY_ENABLED == 'true'
  run: .github/scripts/pipeline-monitoring.sh generate-report
```

2. Configure alert thresholds:
```bash
# In pipeline-monitoring.sh
readonly SUCCESS_RATE_THRESHOLD=95
readonly ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD=30

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)

**For Environment Variables:**
```yaml
# Disable reliability features
PIPELINE_RELIABILITY_ENABLED: 'false'
```

**For Script Issues:**
```bash
# Remove problematic scripts
rm -rf .github/scripts/
git add -A && git commit -m "Rollback: Remove reliability scripts"
```

### Full Rollback (< 20 minutes)

**Complete Workflow Revert:**
1. Revert to previous ci.yml version:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Rollback: Revert CI workflow"
```

2. Remove enhanced actions:
```bash
rm -rf .github/actions/
git add -A && git commit -m "Rollback: Remove enhanced actions"
```

3. Revert Docker optimizations:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- Dockerfile*
git commit -m "Rollback: Revert Docker optimizations"
```

### Partial Rollback

**Disable Specific Features:**
```yaml
# Disable only reliability features
PIPELINE_RELIABILITY_ENABLED: 'false'

# Disable parallel execution
strategy:
  fail-fast: true  # Change from false
  # Remove matrix strategy
```

**Rollback Order (Safest First):**
1. Monitoring and alerting
2. Docker optimizations
3. Pipeline enhancements
4. Enhanced actions
5. Reliability scripts

GO_VERSION: '1.23.4'
```

**Issue:** Docker build path errors
**Solution:**
```dockerfile
# Fix build command in Dockerfile.optimized
RUN go build -o /tmp/freightliner .  # Not ./cmd/freightliner
```

### Performance Issues

**Issue:** Slow cache performance
**Solution:**
```yaml
# Increment cache version to invalidate
CACHE_VERSION: 'v3'
```

**Issue:** Memory issues in parallel jobs
**Solution:**
```yaml
# Reduce parallelism
TEST_PARALLELISM: '1'
BUILD_PARALLELISM: '2'
```

### Reliability Issues

**Issue:** Circuit breaker too sensitive
**Solution:**
```bash
# Adjust thresholds in ci-reliability.sh
readonly CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5  # Increase from 3
```

**Issue:** Recovery scripts fail on macOS
**Solution:**
```bash
# Replace timeout command with gtimeout or alternative
# This affects local development only
```
